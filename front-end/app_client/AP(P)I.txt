APP's API:

1) static Future send_registration (nome, email, password, facolta) async :
	POST to registration server to create a new user with name "nome", email "email", password "password" and faculty "facolta".
	--> TODO: return a Future value that perhaps will be a code, still to decide
	
2) static Future validate_login (email, password, flag) async :
	POST to login server to verify the existence of an account with email "email" and password "password". The value of "flag" is still to decide
	--> return a Future value that will be a boolean: TRUE if the user is registered and the password is correct, FALSE otherwise.
